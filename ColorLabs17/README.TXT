Feedback/Thoughts:
It looks too green, like a Gameboy or something, though the color groups look good

Jason
Feedback/Thoughts:
Color pallet looks better, but maybe switch the orange and the yellow colors

Feedback/Thoughts:
Looks good, but probably darken the yellow to make it look like it fits more
